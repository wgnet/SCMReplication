# Synopsis

This set of scripts was developed to continuously replicate changes
between Perforce and Subversion servers. It is released under the BSD license.
Perforce to Perforce replication scripts were based on the code written by
Sven Erik Knop.

Features:

-   P4(Perforce) to P4 replication
-   P4 to SVN(Subversion) replication
-   SVN to P4 replication
-   APIs, p4python and pysvn, are used.
-   configurable source counter, changeset to stop replication,
    maximum number of changelists to replicate
-   No workspace/working copy need to be created manually
-   Only files modified in a change will be updated and submitted.
-   symlinks supported
-   executable bits are replicated
-   svn externals supported

# Examples

Configuration/command examples can be found in the directory:

	./cfg

<a id="org5c67076"></a>

# Installation

The scripts are tested in Centos 7. They should be able to work with
all Linux distros, provided libs/python modules being installed
properly.

To setup environment in Centos 7:

    sudo ./setupenv.sh
    source buildvenv/bin/activate

# Tests

## Tests location

Tests are available in the following location:

    ./test

<a id="orgbd9c33c"></a>

## Docker containers are used for testing.

-   create the test containers, it may take a while:
    
        sudo yum install -y docker
        sudo systemctl start docker
        cd test/dockerfiles
        # "sudo" in case root permission is needed to build Dockerfiles, Or
        # add user to docker group
        #   # sudo groupadd docker
        #   # sudo usermod -aG docker $USER
        #   log out and in again
        sudo ./setup_test_dockers.sh

-   New docker containers will be created:
    -   buildtest\_p4d\_sampledepot with perforce sample depot, and
    -   buildtest\_svn\_sampledepot with a mirror of <http://svn.apache.org/repos/asf/bigtop>


<a id="orgd8fbf37"></a>

## Run tests

-   run all tests

        # Make sure you are in ./test
        # If you ran the docker containers setup script, you will need to do:
        #   cd ..
        python -m unittest discover -f
        # Ran 204 tests in 4729.528s in my VM.
